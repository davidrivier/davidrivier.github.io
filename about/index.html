    <p><img src="/images/david.png" alt="David Rivier"></p>
<p>As far as I can remember, I have always been involved with building new businesses or products, and this for a long time, well before my professional career starts (working with web agencies, start-ups or launching the <strong>first French Law portal ABCjuris.com</strong> in the late 90s).</p>
<p>I find nothing more exciting than the challenges associated with the creation and the development of a business and working with an extremely talented team. I help organisations understand and respond to their customers needs and translate those needs into products, designs and engineering activities to build and scale those companies.</p>
<p>In the last few years, my activities led me to help a number of companies with transformation and turnaround needs which requires a different type of energy and a totally different motivation. I strongly believe that in those moments, it is very important to tell it like it is to drive the agenda forward.</p>
<p>I am currently the <strong>chief Product Officer (CPO)</strong> at <a href="https://www.wonderbill.com">WonderBill</a> which is parts of Shell Energy where I spent the last two years leading the product, designs, data sciences and software engineering teams to build a new type of proposition centred around household management. Building both our B2C and B2B propositions.</p>

<p>Previously, I was <strong>CPO and Board Member</strong> at <a href="https://www.concreteplatform.com">Concrete Platform</a> helping retail brands to improve their retail execution and store performance. I helped Concrete with its business transformation, leading the product, designs and engineering teams which included building, launching the new Concrete Platform and scaling the business several folds.</p>
<p>Here a number of previous organisations I worked for in <em>senior product leadership positions</em>:</p>
